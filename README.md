# Rhaz's Person Website

Hello!  This is the repository for my personal website.
https://rhaz.me

This website is a presentation of me, as a developer, to the world.  My intention is to build on it over time and improve it as I go.

It is built using React and TailwindCSS, mostly because these are two technologies I would like to gain experience in.


## Getting started

### Install
```
yarn install
```
### Run the application
The application can be run with the following command.
